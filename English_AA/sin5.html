                <div class="textbox">Trend-Fed Malice is the act of joining negativity, judgment, or dislike simply because it is popular. These sinners follow the crowd without thinking, joining trends of mockery, canceling, or shaming even when they do not understand the situation. They do this to feel included, relevant, or accepted, letting popularity replace their own judgment. Their harm comes from careless conformity—hurting others because “everyone else was doing it.”</div>

                <h2>Punishment</h2>

                <!-- ✅ ADDED IMAGE TO FRAME 2 — IDENTICAL STRUCTURE -->

                </div>

                <div class="textbox">Because they depended on crowds for their identity, the sinners are now condemned to exist in complete emptiness — eternally alone. Yet from all directions, unseen voices constantly mock, criticize, and laugh at them, repeating the same mindless insults they once joined. Every attempt to find others leads only to louder jeers. The crowds they followed in life have vanished, leaving them to face the echo of the harm they once helped spread.</div>

                <h2>Allegory</h2>
                <p>Their punishment reflects the core of their moral failure. In life, they allowed the crowd to shape their actions, so in the afterlife the crowd is stripped away, leaving them in total isolation. They once joined in mockery when it was easy, popular, and safe, and now that same mockery surrounds them endlessly, offering no escape. Having never formed convictions or a voice of their own, they are now powerless to silence the countless disembodied voices that torment them. Ultimately, the punishment reveals a deeper truth: blindly following harmful trends drains a person of identity, integrity, and independence until nothing remains but an echo of the voices they once imitated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textbox">
                <h2>Reflection</h2> 
                <p>This sin shows a harsh truth about humans today: we often hop onto trends without thinking, just to feel included, gain attention, or avoid being left out. So many people joined the hate train against an influencer I admired, simply because it was popular. They didn’t pause to consider if what they were doing was right, or even if she was truly at fault. I watched as the momentum of the crowd grew, and it crushed her, piece by piece, under the weight of public judgment. This is the circle I connect with the most. That influencer ended her life because of the endless hate, and so many of the people who joined, some of whom I admired. They attacked her for views, clout, or to be part of a trend, and in the end, regret came too late. No apology, no reflection, could bring her back. This sin, Trend-Fed Malice, reminds me that even small actions such as a like, a comment,and a share, can contribute to real pain. I hope anyone reading this learns to pause, think, and choose kindness, even when everyone else seems to be following the crowd.
